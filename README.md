# Kodi
<p>Kodi is a very versatile media player, a lot of things cand be done using 3rd party addons for kodi.</p>
<p>I am runing Kodi on LibreELEC a light distro of linux that is just enough for runing Kodi. I tried and used many addons but
the most interesting perhaps is Plex, it's a client server media player that let's you stream your media on your LAN network.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Plex is that it provides metadata for mostly any media file you could think of, providing information 
adout series, movies or your music. Because of this if you have a large media collection it almost feels like a paid streaming service.</p>
<p>At some point I had the Plex server runing on a mini PC with low power consumption 24/7, streaming a large collection of series and films,
from a 1TB external hard drive. This felt like our family had it's own streaming service that we coud just add new titles to.</p>
